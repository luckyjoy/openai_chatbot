# Gemini-Powered Flask Chatbot

This project is a secure, authenticated web application built with **Flask** that provides a chat interface powered by the **OpenAI API**. It uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless authentication and **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, responsive design.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Authentication:** User login secured with JWT. The default admin user is created on startup.
* **Gemini AI Integration:** Chat functionality is powered by the `google-genai` SDK and the **`gemini-2.5-flash`** model.
* **Security:** Enforces HTTPS with an ad-hoc SSL context for local development and includes essential security headers.
* **Database:** Uses **SQLite** via Flask-SQLAlchemy for user management.
* **Environment Variables:** Configuration and secrets are managed via the `.env` file.
